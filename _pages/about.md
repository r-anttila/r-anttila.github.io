I am a mathematics PhD student at the [University of Oulu](https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-science/mathematical-sciences). In September 2025, I will start as a Research Fellow at the [University of St Andrews](https://sta-analysis.github.io/), working with [Jonathan Fraser](https://jonathan-fraser.github.io/homepage/). I completed my PhD in mathematics at the University of Oulu in June 2025 under the supervision of [Antti Käenmäki](https://kaenmaki.net/) and [Ville Suomala](https://www.oulu.fi/fi/tutkijat/ville-suomala). 

My research is focused on geometry of fractal sets and measures. Fractals are objects with a complex and detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales and iterated function systems provide a simple and systematic way of constructing fractals, while capturing much of the intricate behavior. In my research, I focus on ways for quantifying the local scaling properties invariant sets and measures for iterated function systems. I'm especially interested in the subtleties induced by the non-conformality of the defining maps in affine iterated function systems, and how these affect the structure of the set at small scales.
