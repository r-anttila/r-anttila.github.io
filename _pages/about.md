I am Roope Anttila, a mathematics PhD student at the [University of Oulu](https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-science/mathematical-sciences). I completed my Master's degree in mathematics at the University of Oulu in the summer of 2021, and began my doctoral studies in the same fall under the supervision of [Antti K채enm채ki](https://anttikaenmaki.wordpress.com/) and [Ville Suomala](https://www.oulu.fi/fi/tutkijat/ville-suomala). 

My research is focused on geometry of fractal sets and measures. Loosely speaking, fractals are objects with a complex and detailed structure at all scales of observation and iterated function systems provide a simple and systematic way of constructing fractals, while capturing much of the intricate behavior. In my research, I focus on ways for quantifying the local scaling properties invariant sets and measures for iterated function systems. I'm especially interested in the subtleties induced by the non-conformality of the defining maps in affine iterated function systems, and how these connect to the structure of the set at small scales.

### Conference announcement
Together with Antti K채enm채ki, Ville Suomala and Sascha Troscheit we are organizing a conference **Geometry and Fractals under the Midnight Sun** at the University of Oulu in June 2024. The conference aims to bring together experts working on the interface between Fractal Geometry, Geometric Measure Theory, Dynamical Systems, and Probability Theory. More information and the registration form can be found on the [conference website](https://midnightsun2024.gitlab.io/). The deadline for registration is 31 May.
