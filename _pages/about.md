I am Roope Anttila, a mathematics PhD student at the [University of Oulu](https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-science/mathematical-sciences). I completed my MSc at the University of Oulu in the summer of 2021, and began my doctoral studies in the same fall under the supervision of [Antti K채enm채ki](https://anttikaenmaki.wordpress.com/) and [Ville Suomala](https://www.oulu.fi/fi/tutkijat/ville-suomala). 

My research is focused on geometry of fractal sets and measures generated by iterated function systems. I am mainly interested in the fine geometry of attractors of non-conformal iterated function systems and local behaviour of measures on conformal and non-conformal attractors.

Together with Antti K채enm채ki, Ville Suomala and Sascha Troscheit we are organizing a conference **Geometry and Fractals under the Midnight Sun** at the University of Oulu in June 2024. The conference aims to bring together experts working on the interface between Fractal Geometry, Geometric Measure Theory, Dynamical Systems, and Probability Theory. More information and the registration form can be found on the [conference website](https://midnightsun2024.gitlab.io/). The deadline for registration is 31 May.
