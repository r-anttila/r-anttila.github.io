I am Roope Anttila, a mathematics PhD student at the [University of Oulu](https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-science/mathematical-sciences). I completed my Master's degree in mathematics at the University of Oulu in the summer of 2021, and began my doctoral studies in the same fall under the supervision of [Antti Käenmäki](https://anttikaenmaki.wordpress.com/) and [Ville Suomala](https://www.oulu.fi/fi/tutkijat/ville-suomala). 

My research is focused on geometry of fractal sets and measures. Loosely speaking, fractals are objects with a complex and detailed structure at all scales of observation and iterated function systems provide a simple and systematic way of constructing fractals, while capturing much of the intricate behavior. In my research, I focus on ways for quantifying the local scaling properties invariant sets and measures for iterated function systems. I'm especially interested in the subtleties induced by the non-conformality of the defining maps in affine iterated function systems, and how these affect the structure of the set at small scales.
