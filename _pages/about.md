I am Roope Anttila, a mathematics PhD student at the University of Oulu. I completed my MSc at the University of Oulu in the summer of 2021, and began my doctoral studies in the same fall under the supervision of [Antti Käenmäki](https://anttikaenmaki.wordpress.com/) and [Ville Suomala](https://www.oulu.fi/fi/tutkijat/ville-suomala). My research is focused on the geometry of sets and measures generated by iterated function systems. In particular, I am interested in Assouad dimensions of self-affine constructions.
