I am Roope Anttila, a mathematics PhD student at the [University of Oulu](https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-science/mathematical-sciences). I completed my MSc at the University of Oulu in the summer of 2021, and began my doctoral studies in the same fall under the supervision of [Antti Käenmäki](https://anttikaenmaki.wordpress.com/) and [Ville Suomala](https://www.oulu.fi/fi/tutkijat/ville-suomala). 

My research is focused on geometry of fractal sets and measures generated by iterated function systems. I am mainly interested in the fine geometry of attractors of non-conformal iterated function systems and local behaviour of measures on conformal and non-conformal attractors.
