We introduce a pointwise variant of the Assouad dimension for measures on metric spaces, and study its properties in relation to the global Assouad dimension. We show that, in general, the value of the pointwise Assouad dimension differs from the global counterpart, but in many classical cases, it exhibits similar exact dimensionality properties as the classical local dimension, namely it equals the global Assouad dimension at almost every point. We also compute the Assouad dimension of invariant measures with place dependent probabilities supported on strongly separated self-conformal sets.
