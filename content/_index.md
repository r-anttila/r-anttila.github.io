title: "About me"
---
I'm a mathematician working as a Research Fellow at the University of St Andrews in the [Analysis Group](https://sta-analysis.github.io/) led by [Jonathan Fraser](https://jonathan-fraser.github.io/homepage/). I completed my PhD in mathematics at the [University of Oulu](https://www.oulu.fi/en/university/faculties-and-units/faculty-science/mathematical-sciences) in June 2025 under the supervision of [Antti Käenmäki](https://kaenmaki.net/) and [Ville Suomala](https://www.oulu.fi/fi/tutkijat/ville-suomala). 

My research is focused on geometry of [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal), objects with a complex and detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. [Iterated function systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system) are a systematic way of constructing fractals, which are simple enough to analyse precisely, while still exhibiting interesting and intricate geometry. Much of my research is focused on quantifying the local scaling properties of invariant sets and measures for iterated function systems, focusing mainly on self-affine and more general non-linear and non-conformal systems. I am also interested in quasisymmetric geometry and random matrix products and random covering sets.

My Erdös number is 3 via the route Anttila-Bárány-Sándor-Erdös.
